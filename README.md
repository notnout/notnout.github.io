The ultimate zero sum game. 

## Development
Note that the JavaScript is super simple - all code served to client is actually used at some point. If some code path is not used, just remove it. 
This is in contrast with most web applications that load large libraries of junk that is never used.  

### Running locally 
Run with simple server
```sh
python -m SimpleHttpServer
```
